    - Employee Task Tracker:
        a) This Python application tracks employee working hours and tasks.
        b) Each day, an employee logs in, starts and ends tasks, and logs out.
        c) The task details are saved in a daily JSON file.


- Monthly meeting with HR to discuss my experiences and progress related to the training.
